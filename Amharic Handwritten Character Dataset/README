The Amharic Handwritten Character Dataset
==========================================
* This is an Amharic handwritten character dataset
* The dataset is organized from [1] (e.g. see 'Ahw_71.jpg') by extracting the isolated characters using bounding box annotation tool [3]
* 'Character Images' folder contains 46,375 character bounding box gray scale images (265 amharic characters X 175 writers)
* The name of the character images for example:'Amh_23_165' means 'Amharic_CharacterID/label_WriterID'
* There are three numpy files: Amh_train_set.npy, Amh_valid_set.npy, and Amh_test_set.npy
* The above three files have 39750 X 5, 3975 X 5, and 2650 X 5 shapes respectively
	-> 39750 = 265 characters X 150 writers
	-> 3975 = 265 characters X 15 writers
	-> 2650 = 265 characters X 10 writers
	-> Finally the 5 columns hold [32x32] image data, label, row, col, and writerID
* The row and col are given as per 'Amharic Characters.pdf' which is organized and pronounced following [2]
* The labels however are given as per 'Ahw_71.jpg' in their writing order from 1-265
* The writerIDs are directly used from the file names identifying the writers 
* WriterIDs are given from 1 - 218 as the participants were 218
* However, it was identified that only 175 participants have fully completed the writing
* The access and usage of the original unsegmented image dataset is by the permission of authors [1]. Hence, you must get the same permission from these authors to use this dataset for any purpose.
