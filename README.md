# Amharic Handwritten Character Dataset
This repository contains two datasets. The first one is Amharic Handwritten Character Dataset. Inside this folder there is a README file providing the detailed description of the dataset. The second dataset is Amharic Handwritten Character Dataset for Few-shot Learning. A detailed description of this dataset with its benchmark experiment will be presented in a conference paper which will be published soon [3]. <!-- is presented in the paper by Gondere et. al., []. -->
